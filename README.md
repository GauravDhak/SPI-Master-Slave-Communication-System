# SPI Master-Slave Communication System

## Project Description

This project involves the design and implementation of an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Master-Slave communication system using Verilog. The SPI master module is capable of interfacing with multiple slave devices, making it suitable for a variety of embedded systems applications, including sensor interfacing and memory communication.

## Features

- SPI Master module implementation in Verilog
- Supports communication with multiple slave devices using chip select signals
- State machine design for managing data transfer and clock generation
- Comprehensive testbench for simulation and verification
- FPGA implementation for hardware validation

### SPI Master

| Signal    | Direction | Description                    |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| `clk`     | Input     | System clock                   |
| `rst`     | Input     | Reset signal                   |
| `data_in` | Input     | Data to be sent via SPI        |
| `start`   | Input     | Start signal to initiate SPI   |
| `cs`      | Input     | Chip select signals for slaves |
| `spi_clk` | Output    | SPI clock signal               |
| `mosi`    | Output    | Master Out Slave In            |
| `miso`    | Input     | Master In Slave Out            |
| `data_out`| Output    | Received data from slave       |
| `done`    | Output    | Transaction completion signal  |

### Pin Connections

- `clk`: Connect to the system clock source.
- `rst`: Connect to the reset signal.
- `data_in`: Connect to the data source that needs to be sent to the slave.
- `start`: Connect to a control signal to initiate the SPI transaction.
- `cs`: Connect to the chip select signals for the slave devices.
- `spi_clk`: Connect to the SPI clock line.
- `mosi`: Connect to the Master Out Slave In line.
- `miso`: Connect to the Master In Slave Out line from the slave.
- `data_out`: Connect to the data sink to receive data from the slave.
- `done`: Connect to a control signal to indicate the end of the transaction.

### Explanation

- **SPI Clock (`spi_clk`)**: The clock signal generated by the SPI master.
- **Master Out Slave In (`mosi`)**: Data line carrying bits from master to slave.
- **Master In Slave Out (`miso`)**: Data line carrying bits from slave to master.
- **Chip Select (`cs`)**: Signal to select the active slave device.
- **Data Transfer**: Data is transferred on the rising edge of `spi_clk`.
